# A French poetry corpus : **Le Lac** by Alphonse de Lamartine, **L'Albatros** by Charles Baudelaire and **La courbe de tes yeux** by Paul Eluard.
For this third step, we must be able to present a final version of the project, a customization of tei model which works on all of our texts. In my case, there are poems.  
The ojective here was to insist on the caracteristics of the type of document we had. My corpus, a French poetry must be interpreted as a poetry corpus, with stanzas and none paragraphs... with an particular care to the rhymes.
I hope this will be work! And I wish you a pleasant reading.
