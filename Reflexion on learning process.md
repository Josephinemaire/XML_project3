# Reflexive note
Here I will try to expose my learning process during all the semester in XML-TEI classes. 
I have to say that I like a lot learn XML-TEI things because I am interested in edition applications in TNAH. 
At first, I was a bit confused by the fact that this course was taught in English, and I had to work hard to understand it at the beginning. But in the end, the slides were very educational, and I managed to understand more and more, even if I still struggle sometimes.

- Assignement 1 was the beginning learning process. Discovery of TEI in english, it was so difficult to understand the classes. Classmates helped me in understanding of the diapos and my love for poetry did the rest. I loved so much imagine a project, and all the creative aspects of that and that's what I liked most about the project.

- Assignement 2 was the step of understanding even though the score was lower than the first one. I went back through the slides and reread last year's course on encoding, and I really enjoyed encoding these texts that I love so much.

- Assignement 3 was the most hard step in the project. My computer crashed during the project and I wasted time. But I found the objective very interesting, the idea of determine rules to encode the 3 texts in an only schema. Even if it was very hard, and there are too many errors in the code. I found it interesting to see how a poetry corpus is organised and published today.
